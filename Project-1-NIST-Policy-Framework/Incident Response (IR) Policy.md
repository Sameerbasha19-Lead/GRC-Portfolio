Company: Gulf Digital Trust Bank Effective Date: [Today's Date] Policy Owner: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

**1. Policy Objective**

**(The "why")**

The objective of this policy is to establish a formal, bank-wide capability to detect, respond to, and recover from cybersecurity incidents. A rapid and effective response is critical to protect customer assets, limit financial losses, mitigate reputational damage, and ensure swift compliance with CBUAE regulatory reporting requirements.

**2. Scope**

**(The "who" and "what")**

This policy applies to all bank employees, contractors, and systems. It covers any event that compromises the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of the bank's data or services. This includes, but is not limited to, data breaches, fraud, malware infections (like ransomware), and denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.

**3. Policy Statements**

**(The "rules" — this defines the process)**

This policy is based on a four-phased approach to incident handling:

**Phase 1:** Detection and Reporting

**Detection:** The IT Security team will deploy and maintain 24/7 monitoring, logging, and alert systems (e.g., SIEM, fraud detection) to identify suspicious activity in real-time.

**Mandatory Reporting:** All employees are required to immediately report any suspected security incident or policy violation to the IT Help Desk. This includes suspicious emails, lost devices, or unusual account activity. Speed is critical.

**Triage:** The IT Security team will immediately assess the report to determine if it is a genuine security incident and what its potential impact is (e.g., "Low," "Medium," "High," "Critical").

**Phase 2:** Containment, Eradication, and Analysis

**Containment:** The immediate priority is to stop the incident from spreading. This may include isolating affected systems from the network (e.g., locking a customer's account, taking a server offline).

**Analysis:** The Security Team will investigate the incident to identify the "root cause." How did the attacker get in? What data was accessed?

**Eradication:** Once the root cause is found, the team will eliminate it (e.g., remove the malware, patch the vulnerability).

**Phase 3:** Recovery and Restoration

**Restore Service:** The team will safely restore affected systems and data (e.g., from clean backups) and validate that they are secure and functioning normally.

**Monitor:** Systems will be placed under high-scrutiny monitoring to ensure the threat is truly gone.

**Phase 4:** Post-Incident Review

**Lessons Learned:** Within two weeks of any "High" or "Critical" incident, a post-incident review must be held.

**Report:** A formal report will be created documenting the incident, the response, the impact, and the lessons learned to improve future responses.

Regulatory Reporting: The CISO and Legal team will ensure all mandatory reports are filed with the UAE Central Bank within the required timeframes.

**4. Roles and Responsibilities**

**(The "who does what" in an emergency)**

**Cybersecurity Incident Response Team (CIRT):** A dedicated team, led by the CISO, responsible for executing the response plan (Phases 1-3).

**Legal & Compliance:** Responsible for advising on legal obligations and managing all regulatory reporting (e.g., to the Central Bank).

**IT Help Desk:** The "front line" for receiving all incident reports from employees.

**All Employees:** Responsible for being vigilant and reporting all suspected incidents immediately.

**5. Compliance Monitoring**

**(The "how we check")**

The Incident Response plan must be tested at least annually via "tabletop exercises" or simulations.

All security incidents, and the bank's response, must be logged and tracked in a central ticketing system.

Failure to report a known security incident is a severe violation of policy and will result in disciplinary action.
