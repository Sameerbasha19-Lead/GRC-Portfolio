Company: Gulf Digital Trust Bank Effective Date: [Today's Date] Policy Owner: Chief Data Officer (CDO) / CISO

**1. Policy Objective**

(The "why") 

The objective of this policy is to categorize all bank data based on its sensitivity, criticality, and legal requirements. This classification ensures that all information assets are protected with the appropriate level of security controls (e.g., encryption, access restrictions) and handled correctly throughout their lifecycle (creation, storage, transmission, destruction).

2. Scope

(The "who" and "what") 

This policy applies to all data created, collected, stored, or processed by Gulf Digital Trust Bank, regardless of its format (digital or physical). It applies to all employees, contractors, and third-party vendors who handle bank data.

3. Policy Statements

(The "rules"—defining the levels)


Gulf Digital Trust Bank data is classified into four levels:

Level 4: Strictly Confidential

Definition: The bank's most sensitive data. Unauthorized disclosure would cause severe financial, legal, or reputational damage and violate regulatory laws (CBUAE).

Examples: Customer PII + financial data (account numbers, balances), authentication credentials (passwords, PINs), internal investigation records, regulatory reports.

Handling Rules:

Must be encrypted at rest and in transit.

Access is restricted to a "need-to-know" basis, approved by a Data Owner.

Must not be sent via unencrypted email or stored on personal/unapproved devices.

Physical documents must be in locked cabinets.

Level 3: Confidential

Definition: Sensitive internal bank data. Unauthorized disclosure could negatively impact operations, strategy, or customer trust.

Examples: Internal financial reports, business strategy documents, employee HR records (salaries, performance reviews), non-public loan applications.

Handling Rules:

Access is restricted to internal employees and approved vendors.

Should be encrypted at rest and in transit.

Must not be shared with the public.

Level 2: Internal

Definition: Data intended for use within the bank but not considered sensitive. Disclosure would not cause significant harm but is not desired.

Examples: Internal employee memos, company directories (internal phone lists), IT procedures, general operating policies.

Handling Rules:

Available to all internal employees.

Must not be distributed externally without management approval.

Level 1: Public

Definition: Data approved for public release.

Examples: Marketing brochures, website content, press releases, public-facing product information (interest rates).

Handling Rules:

No restrictions on access or distribution.

4. Roles and Responsibilities
(The "who does what")

Data Owners: (e.g., Head of Retail Banking, Head of HR) Responsible for classifying the data their department creates and owns.

Data Users: (All Employees) Responsible for understanding the classification of the data they handle and protecting it according to this policy.

IT Security Team: Responsible for implementing the technical controls (like encryption and access rules) that enforce this policy.

5. Compliance Monitoring
(The "how we check")

The IT Security Team will conduct periodic scans and audits to ensure sensitive data is properly classified and protected.

Data Owners are responsible for reviewing their data classifications annually.

Mishandling of data, especially "Strictly Confidential" data, will result in immediate investigation and disciplinary action.
