# Project 1 — NIST Policy Framework

This directory contains materials for Project 1: implementing a NIST-based policy framework.

Contents:
- README.md (this file)
- policies/ — place policy documents (e.g., Information Security Policy, Access Control Policy)
- templates/ — templates for policy documents and assessments
- evidence/ — implementation evidence, such as screenshots, logs, or audit outputs

Purpose:
- Provide a centralized location for NIST Cybersecurity Framework (or relevant NIST guidance) policy development and artifacts for this project.
- Project Context: Hypothetical Organization
To make this project realistic, all policies were written for a hypothetical organization:

Company Name: "Gulf Digital Trust Bank"

Industry: A mid-sized digital bank (250 employees) in Dubai.

Sensitive Data: Customer PII (Emirates IDs), financial data (account numbers, balances), and transaction histories.

GRC Goal: The policies in this folder were written to meet the high-security needs of a bank, focusing on protecting customer financial data and complying with UAE Central Bank (CBUAE) regulations.

How to use:
1. Add policy documents to the `policies/` folder.
2. Use `templates/` for standardized policy formats.
3. Store implementation evidence in `evidence/`.
