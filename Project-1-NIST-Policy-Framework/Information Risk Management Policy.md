Company: Gulf Digital Trust Bank Effective Date: [Today's Date] Policy Owner: Chief Risk Officer (CRO) / CISO

**1. Policy Objective**

**(The "why")**

The objective of this policy is to establish a formal, consistent, and bank-wide framework for identifying, assessing, managing, and monitoring information security risks. This proactive process ensures that the bank's leadership can make informed decisions to protect its assets, meet its strategic goals, and comply with all regulatory requirements (e.g., CBUAE).

**2. Scope**

**(The "who" and "what")** 

This policy applies to all information assets and business processes within Gulf Digital Trust Bank. It covers all forms of risk that could impact the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of bank data and systems, including technological, human, and environmental risks.

**3. Policy Statements**

(The "rules" — this defines the risk management lifecycle)

This policy mandates a continuous risk management lifecycle with the following key stages:

**1. Risk Identification:**

The bank will maintain a central "Risk Register" to log all identified risks.

Formal risk assessments must be conducted at least annually, or whenever a significant change occurs (e.g., launching a new mobile banking app, onboarding a major new vendor).

**2. Risk Analysis & Assessment:**

Each identified risk must be analyzed to determine its:

**Impact:** The potential harm (financial, reputational, operational) to the bank if the risk occurs (e.g., Critical, High, Medium, Low).

**Likelihood:** The probability of the risk occurring (e.g., High, Medium, Low).

The combination of Impact and Likelihood determines the overall Risk Level.

**3. Risk Treatment (Response):**

For each identified risk, a formal treatment plan must be chosen. The bank accepts four possible responses:

**Mitigate:** Apply security controls to reduce the risk to an acceptable level (e.g., implement MFA to mitigate access risk). This is the most common response.

**Transfer:** Shift the risk to a third party (e.g., buy a cybersecurity insurance policy).

**Accept:** If the risk is low and the cost of mitigation is too high, leadership can formally accept the risk in writing.

**Avoid:** Discontinue the activity that causes the risk (e.g., decide not to launch a new product because it is too insecure).

**4. Risk Monitoring & Review:**

The Risk Register is a living document and must be reviewed continuously by the risk management team.

All "High" and "Critical" risks must be reported to the Board of Directors' Risk Committee on a quarterly basis.


**4. Roles and Responsibilities**

**(The "who does what")**

**Board of Directors / Risk Committee:** Has ultimate oversight and is responsible for defining the bank's "risk appetite" (the level of risk the bank is willing to accept).

**Chief Risk Officer (CRO):** Owns the overall enterprise risk management framework.

**CISO (Chief Information Security Officer):** Owns the information security risk framework and is responsible for executing this policy.

**System/Data Owners:** Responsible for identifying and reporting risks related to their specific systems and data.

**All Employees:** Responsible for identifying and reporting potential risks to their managers.

**5. Compliance Monitoring**

**(The "how we check")**

The Internal Audit department will conduct an independent review of the bank's risk management processes at least annually.

All risk assessment activities, decisions, and treatment plans must be documented for regulatory review.

Failure to follow this risk management framework may result in unmitigated risks, regulatory penalties, and operational losses.
