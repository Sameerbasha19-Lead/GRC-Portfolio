Company: Gulf Digital Trust Bank Effective Date: [Today's Date] Policy Owner: Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)

**1. Policy Objective**

(The "why") 

The objective of this policy is to enforce the principle of "least privilege" and "need-to-know" for all access to Gulf Digital Trust Bank's information, systems, and facilities. This policy is designed to protect customer data, financial records, and critical infrastructure from unauthorized access, disclosure, modification, or destruction, in compliance with UAE Central Bank regulations.

**2. Scope**

(The "who" and "what")

This policy applies to all bank employees, contractors, third-party vendors, and any individual granted access to the bank's non-public information or systems. This includes all data, applications, network devices, and physical locations (e.g., data centers, bank branches).

**3. Policy Statements**

(The "rules"—this is the most important part)


**Unique User IDs**: All users must be assigned a unique User ID for accessing bank systems. Account sharing is strictly prohibited and is a fireable offense.

**Authentication**: All access to systems containing sensitive data (especially customer financial data) must require Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).

**Principle of Least Privilege (PoLP)**: Users will only be granted the minimum level of access and permissions necessary to perform their specific job.

**Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Access rights shall be granted based on pre-defined employee roles (e.g., "Bank Teller," "Loan Officer," "IT Admin"). Any access outside this role requires formal, temporary approval.

**Access Reviews**: Managers must review the access rights of their team members every quarter (90 days). The IT Security team will audit these reviews.

**Access Revocation**: All system access for a departing employee must be disabled immediately upon notification from Human Resources. Contractor access must be auto-revoked on their contract end date.

**Password/Passphrase**: Passwords must be a minimum of 14 characters, complex, and changed every 90 days.

**Session Lock**: User workstations must automatically lock after 10 minutes of inactivity.

**4. Roles and Responsibilities**

(The "who does what")


**Chief Information Security Officer (CISO)**: The ultimate owner of this policy.

**IT Security Team**: Responsible for implementing, monitoring, and auditing access controls and conducting investigations.

**System/Data Owners**: (e.g., Head of Retail Banking) Responsible for defining who should have access to their data.

**Managers**: Responsible for approving access requests for their staff and conducting quarterly access reviews.

All Users: Responsible for safeguarding their credentials, locking their screens, and reporting any unauthorized access attempts immediately.

**5. Compliance Monitoring**

(The "how we check")


The IT Security Team will conduct regular audits of access logs and user permission lists.

All access requests and approvals must be formally logged in the IT ticketing system.

Any violation of this policy will be treated as a serious security incident and may result in disciplinary action, up to and including termination of employment and potential legal action.
